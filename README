This is the entire project folder for our project that you can import into Eclipse. Source files
are in the src/main folder and com/google/zxing/integration/android is where the ZXing library lives
along with Google's authentication generator. The GUI Layout files are in res/layout and the menu is
in res/menu.

---Status---
-Outputs the contents of the scanned QR Code
-Calculates a 6-digit time sensitive auth code to make each authentication request different
  from the last one. It increments every 100 seconds.
-Displays the UUID,IMEI,Phone Number, and the final 
  Auth String(made up of: UUID,IMEI,PhoneNo,AuthCode,Username,Password)
  when you press the Generate Auth String button.
-Auth String is of the format: [section]=VALUE& (eg. AuthCode=123456&) for all components
-Displays the encrypted version of the Auth String as well(shows up weird)
-You can enter your username and password by going to Menu->Settings. If
  this isn't done before setting the username/password it inputs a username/
  password of "null".
-Upon scanning the QR Code it sends an HTTP POST request to our server which
  contains the encrypted Auth String, unix time code, and the type(login or register)
  and grabs its response.


---TODO---
-Program crashes when you press the Generate Auth String twice. :\
-Still need to handle Phone Registration(need Login API/method)
-Add the unique URL to the SendAuth function so it sends the POST to the 
  one-time page.
-Have an option to remember your username/password and then save those values
  to a file on the phones disk.
-Probably more stuff...
